## Features

- Run JS functions as hooks
- Helper functions for common tasks such as parsing incoming queries
- Support for running multiple JS functions as hooks
- Prometheus metrics for monitoring

## Build for testing

To build the plugin for development and testing, run the following command:

```bash
make build-dev
```

Running the above command causes the `go mod tidy` and `go build` to run for compiling and generating the plugin binary in the current directory, named `gatewayd-plugin-js`.

> [!WARNING]
> This plugin is experimental and is not recommended for production use. This is unless you know what you are doing.
